									<p>The ongoing conflict in Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022, has unfolded as a result of the Russian Federation's invasion, leading to a dire humanitarian crisis and geopolitical tensions. As of the latest reports from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), approximately 5.1 million people have been internally displaced, and more than 6.2 million have sought refuge in neighbouring countries such as Poland, Hungary, Moldova, and others worldwide.</p>

									<p>Liver diseases are a significant health concern and a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Among the various liver diseases, liver tumors are particularly noteworthy. These tumors represent abnormal and uncontrolled growths of liver cells, which can develop on the surface or within the liver itself. Liver tumors can be benign or malignant, with the latter posing a serious threat due to its potential to spread to other parts of the body. Early detection and effective treatment are crucial in managing liver tumors and improving patient outcomes.</p>

									<p> Times are constantly evolving, and the advent of technology has brought numerous practical benefits. From basic educational tools to solving complex mathematical equations, technology has fundamentally transformed our perception of life. Facial recognition plays a crucial role in enhancing security and convenience across various sectors. It is used in law enforcement to identify suspects, in airports to streamline boarding processes, and in smartphones for secure access. By accurately identifying individuals based on their unique facial features, facial recognition helps prevent unauthorized access and enhances public safety.</p>

									<p> Biases in data can lead to distorted results and perpetuate existing societal inequalities. Tackling gender bias in datasets and machine learning models is essential for ensuring fairness and equity in decision-making processes. By actively identifying and mitigating these biases, we can create more inclusive and representative models. This, in turn, helps to prevent the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes and supports the development of technologies that benefit all segments of society. Furthermore, promoting transparency and accountability in the creation and deployment of these models is vital for fostering trust and integrity in AI systems. </p>

									<a href="https://github.com/Vineeth-john/TSLA-stock-prediction" class="image fit"><img src="images/maxim-hopman-fiXLQXAhCfk-unsplash.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The stock market is a dynamic and complex system, influenced by countless factors ranging from economic indicators to investor sentiment. Predicting stock prices is a challenging task that requires advanced analytical techniques due to the market's inherent volatility and unpredictability. In this project, I utilize Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast Tesla's stock price. LSTM, a type of recurrent neural network, excels in processing and predicting time series data. By analyzing historical stock prices and financial indicators, this project aims to provide accurate predictions, helping investors and analysts navigate the uncertainties of the stock market.</p>

									<p> The movie industry is a dynamic and influential sector that impacts culture and economy globally. Analyzing trends within this industry provides valuable insights into audience preferences, economic performance, and market dynamics. By observing language patterns, genre popularity, and financial metrics, stakeholders can make informed decisions, optimize marketing strategies, and predict future trends. Such analysis helps filmmakers, producers, and investors understand the evolving landscape of cinema, ensuring they can effectively cater to audience demands and maximize their returns.</p>
