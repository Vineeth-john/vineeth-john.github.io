					<p>
						I am an engineer by training and a thinker by choice. Originally from India, I had the unique opportunity to grow up in the Middle East, specifically Kuwait. This experience has granted me the privilege of calling two countries home. Living in different countries has provided me with a rich perspective on life, allowing me to embrace multiple cultures and ideologies, which I consider my greatest asset.

					<p>
						My educational journey began in Kuwait, where I completed my schooling. I pursued my undergraduate studies in India and later, my master's in the United States. This international exposure enabled me to interact with a diverse array of cultures, opinions, and ideologies, significantly shaping my worldview and making me a more adaptive person.

						From a young age, I have always been meticulous in my decision-making process, a trait that has only grown stronger with time. During my early undergraduate years, I discovered the fascinating world of data science. For someone as detail-oriented as I am, it was clear that I had found my true calling in this field.

						My passion for data science stems from my desire to uncover insights, drive decisions, and create innovative solutions. Through my projects, I aim to harness the power of data to make a meaningful impact. Explore my work to see how I leverage data to uncover insights, drive decisions, and craft innovative solutions.
